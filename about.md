### About
An Enthusiastic and Inquisitive human exploring stuffs made of 0s and 1s.

I began my carrier designing Automated Guided Vehicles, then stepped into data extraction for building Digital Triplets. As a part of my work at DFKI I also designed a wearable sensor suit. From there I worked with CISPA on baremetal hypervisors. I now work on 3D point clouds for autonomous driving.And yes, getting out my comfort zone, doesn't scare me anymore :)

At the moment Deep learning, Security and Software Engineering excite me the most!
